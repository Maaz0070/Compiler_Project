# Scanner and Parser for Compiler

This C++ project implements a scanner and parser for a compiler. The project includes functionalities for parsing various types of statements and expressions in the source code. The scanner and parser work together to analyze the input source code and create a parse tree representing its structure.

## Overview

This project consists of a scanner and a parser designed to work together for compiling source code. The scanner reads the input source code file and tokenizes it, while the parser processes the tokens generated by the scanner to build a parse tree that represents the syntax and structure of the code.

## Installation

To use this scanner and parser, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Compile the `parser.cpp` file along with the necessary dependencies. Ensure you have a suitable C++ compiler installed on your system.

3. Once compiled, you can execute the compiled binary to process source code files.


## Usage

## g++ required to make program, or change CC in makefile

# Instructions:

1. make
2. ./output -parse [filename] OR ./output -scan [filename]
3. input file should be in same directory as main.cpp
4. default command ./output -parse test-in.txt
5. output is printed in cout and test-out.txt

## Classes

The project includes the following classes:

- `Scanner`: Responsible for tokenizing the input source code.
- `SymTab`: Symbol table implementation.
- `Node`: Represents nodes in the parse tree.
- `Parser`: Implements the parsing logic, constructs the parse tree, and handles various types of statements and expressions.
